    <p>Hey. This would probably be the last thing I'd do for you since you're moving na sa Manila and we'll both be busy.</p>

    <p>You were amazing, LJ. Those calls na we did, the time na we spent sa 39ers that day â€” ewan ko for you if you'd consider that as a date, but I kind of did. And you might say na baka I say this to others too (like Lei), <strong>no</strong>. You're the first na I ever experienced that kind of thing. <strong>You're special for me, LJ.</strong></p>

    <p>And while Sean's more provocative and louder way of showing his love for you might win, just know that <strong>I love you genuinely</strong>, and <em>is</em> willing to fight for you and your family.</p>

    <p>I hope you have fun in Manila while staying safe, we both know na it's not safe there. And kahit wag mo na basahin lahat, ito lang. Sana <strong>magpahinga pag sinasabi ng katawan na magpahinga</strong>, okay? Seryoso 'to.</p>

    <p><em>I love you in the purest, most genuine form, without hesitation, without expectationâ€”just love, as it was always meant to be.</em></p>
